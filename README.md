### Summary

What is a cloud
- Many definitions
- NIST defines 5 critical characteristics to be a cloud
    - On-demand self service
    - Broad Network Access
    - Resource Pooling
    - Rapid Elasticity
    - Measured Services

### Tips
- Use new resource groups for each lab you do. The reason why you want to do so is to allow you to spin down, terminate everything associated with each lab at the same time and not leaving things behind. Also tagging with metadata is good practice
